## About the repository
A platform to try out new code and software tools some time in 2024 as a means of **learning**. 

Note: Almost all the code (code relating to the CRUD) to test out whether the containers are communicating is copied from https://github.com/AmishaChordia/FastAPI-PostgreSQL-Docker/tree/master <br>

This file may be changed to test for Github actions.

### Outstanding issues (main one only)
1] Input component reset status cyclic problem <br>

2] Docker networking naming <br>

3] Understanding Database, model, schema, etc. <br>
