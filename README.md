Note: Almost all the code (code relating to the CRUD) to test out whether the containers are communicating is copied from https://github.com/AmishaChordia/FastAPI-PostgreSQL-Docker/tree/master <br>

This file may be changed to test for Github actions.

### Outstanding issues (main one only)
1] Input component reset status cyclic problem <br>

2] Docker networking naming <br>

3] Understanding Database, model, schema, etc. <br>

4] Github Actions deploy to AWS EC2 (docker compose refined)<br>
